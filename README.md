Monitors changes on FWGS whiskey release page. Make sure you update the following:

    'email_user': '<email>',
    'email_pass': '<app password>',
    'notify_email': ['<email_1>', '<email_2>'],

I used gmail. You can generate an application password in gmail for API usage. By default, it runs every 5 minutes.
